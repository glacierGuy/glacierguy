### About Me

I am a Masters student at Colorado School of Mines, studying Hydrogeophysics and Glaciology! My particular specialization is in *Paleoglaciology*, which is the study of how glaciers have changed in the past. I earned my B.S. in Earth Science (now called Climate Science) at Oregon State University in 2022. My interests outside of glaciology include hiking, watching science fiction movies and TV shows, collecting CDs, and watching the rain.

**More stuff about me:**
- Pronouns: He/Him
- Favorite mascot: a tie between Benny the Beaver and Blaster the Burro
- Favorite coding langauge: Python
- Favorite food: quesadillas with bell peppers

### Current Project(s)
- **paleoPEAR:** A Python repository is in the works for calculating cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages, particularly in regards to previous extents of glaciers and ice sheets. This repository is a sort of re-make of the iceTEA (Tools for Exposure Ages at Ice Margins) repository linked [here](http://ice-tea.org/en/), coded mostly in MATLAB. My repository, Python Exposure Age Repository for Paleoglaciology (paleoPEAR) will be coded mostly -- or entirely -- in Python. In addition to beryllium-10 and aluminum-26, I will add support for *in-situ* cosmogenic carbon-14. The repository will be private until it is ready to be used for science.
